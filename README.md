Repository for my simulation and analysis codes in BU Silicon Photonics Group

Majority of codes are in MATLAB and python.

## AL11a

These codes are concerned with some post-processing steps I did in Boston University's Photonics center cleanroom. The aim was to be able to simulate the resonance frequencies of a ring resonator with different cross-sections.
